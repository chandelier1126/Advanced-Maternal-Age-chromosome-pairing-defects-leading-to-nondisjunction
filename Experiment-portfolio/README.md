# Yeast Aging & Meiosis Bioinformatics Portfolio

This portfolio summarizes three computational analyses derived from experimental data on **yeast meiosis and aging**, conducted under Prof. Keun P. Kim’s lab (Chung-Ang University).

##  Project Structure
| Folder | Description |
|--------|--------------|
| `Sir2_RNAseq/` | RNA-seq differential expression analysis between WT and Sir2(R139K) yeast |
| `Rec8_Network/` | Protein interaction and cohesin network visualization |
| `TetR_GFP_CellCycle/` | Image-based cell cycle and chromosome segregation analysis |

---

##  Research Background
Aging is known to induce **chromosome mis-segregation (nondisjunction)** during meiosis, largely due to defects in cohesin stability and the synaptonemal complex.  
This portfolio integrates computational and experimental data to show how **Sir2 mutation accelerates meiosis and destabilizes the Rec8 cohesin complex** in *Saccharomyces cerevisiae*.

---

##  Key Findings
- **Sir2(*R139K*)** mutant shows **faster meiotic progression**
- **Rec8** expression peaks and declines earlier in mutants
- **TetR–GFP assay** reveals premature sister chromatid separation
- These findings model how **aging-related cohesin defects** may underlie **aneuploidy** in higher organisms
