# Advanced Maternal Age: Chromosome Pairing Defects Leading to Nondisjunction

This project investigates how aging affects meiotic chromosome segregation using *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* as a model organism.  
We compared **Sir2(R139K) mutant** yeast with **wild-type (WT)** to understand how aging influences cohesin stability and chromosome pairing.

##  Overview
Aging is known to cause chromosome mis-segregation and reduce meiotic efficiency.  
This study explores how the Sir2(R139K) mutant accelerates meiosis and destabilizes the Rec8 cohesin complex, leading to **premature sister chromatid separation**.

##  Experimental Components
| Analysis | Tool / Method | Main Result |
|-----------|----------------|--------------|
| Yeast Aging Assay | Calorie restriction (0.5% glucose) | Sir2 mutant shows accelerated aging phenotype |
| Division Curve | SPM medium, DAPI staining | Mutant enters meiosis ~2 hrs earlier |
| Rec8 Immunofluorescence | Microscopy + ImageJ | Rec8 appears/disappears earlier in mutant |
| Western Blot | PVDF membrane, HRP detection | Rec8 peaks earlier and declines faster |
| TetR–GFP System | Chromosome II tagging | Mutant shows premature chromatid separation |
